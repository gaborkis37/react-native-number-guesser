# Number guesser game

This is small React Native game where you can select a number, then the program will try to guess it. Then you can tell whether the guessed number is
lower or greater than your number. You should do this until the program finds the correct number. When the correct one is guessed the game is over and you
can start a new one.
During the guessing phase the previous guesses are listed on the screen.
